### Grad file

The grad file encodes the MR acquisition parameters for each imaging volume. The format is essentially an MRtrix-style grad file with extra columns. Each row corresponds to one imaging volume, and contains space-separated values [x y z b DELTA, delta, G, TE, TI, TR], where

x, y, z are the diffusion gradient directions
b is the b-value
DELTA is the time between the two gradient pulses
delta is the pulse gradient duration
TE is the echo time
TI is the inversion time
TR is the repitition time
